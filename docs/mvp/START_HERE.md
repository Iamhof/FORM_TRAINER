## 📋 Your Action Items

### ⭐ PRIORITY 1: Create Visual Assets (Required for deployment)

**You MUST complete these before building:**

#### A. App Icon (2-4 hours)
- Design 1024x1024px icon
- **Easiest:** Use Canva templates (free)
- **Professional:** Hire on Fiverr ($20-50)
- Save as `assets/images/icon.png`
- Copy to `assets/images/adaptive-icon.png`

#### B. Splash Screen (30 min)
- Update `assets/images/splash-icon.png`
- Use same icon on dark background
- Simple and clean

#### C. Screenshots (1 hour)
- Test app on your iPhone
- Capture 5-6 key screens
- Save for store submissions

**DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:** See `docs/MVP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Step 1

---

### ⭐ PRIORITY 2: Host Privacy Policy (Required)

**You have the policy:** `docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`

**Host it online (15 minutes):**
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Upload privacy policy
4. Get URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/reponame`

**This URL is required** for both App Store and Play Store.

**DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:** See `docs/MVP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Step 2

---

### ⭐ PRIORITY 3: Build & Deploy (After assets complete)

#### Install Tools (5 minutes)
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

#### Configure Project (5 minutes)
```bash
cd "C:\My Apps\FORM_APP\rork-OJ-form-main"
eas build:configure
```

#### Build Both Platforms (~30 minutes total)
```bash
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

Builds happen in cloud - you can close your computer and wait!

#### Submit to Stores
```bash
eas submit --platform all --profile production
```

Then complete store listings using templates in `docs/STORE_LISTINGS.md`.

**DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:** See `docs/MVP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Steps 3-7

## ❓ FAQs

### Q: Can I launch without fixing the emulator?
**A:** YES! You don't need the emulator to deploy. EAS builds in the cloud.

### Q: Will users see errors about backend?
**A:** NO! Backend features are hidden with "Coming Soon" screens.

### Q: What if users want features that are "Coming Soon"?
**A:** Perfect! That tells you what to build in v1.1. Feature prioritization!

### Q: Can I update the app after launch?
**A:** YES! Over-the-air updates for JS changes (instant), store updates for big changes.

### Q: Do I need to test on Android if I have iPhone?
**A:** TestFlight (iOS) is sufficient for initial testing. EAS builds both platforms anyway.

### Q: How long until I can launch?
**A:** If you work efficiently: 1-2 weeks until apps are live in stores.
