### For Reddit (r/fitness, r/weightroom):
```
Hey everyone! I built a simple workout tracking app focused on programme building and progress logging.

**What it does:**
- Create custom training programmes
- Log exercises, sets, reps, weight
- Track workout history

**Why I built it:**
Existing apps were either too complicated or lacked good programme building. This focuses on the essentials.

**It's completely free** (no ads, no upsells). Would love feedback from serious lifters!
